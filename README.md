## Key Functionalities Explained

### Filtering Logic
The app filters companies by:
- Search term (matches name, industry, or location)
- Selected location
- Selected industry

Filtering also automatically **resets the current page to 1** for accurate results.

### 📄 Pagination
Pagination dynamically adjusts based on filtered results:
```js
const totalPages = Math.ceil(filteredCompanies.length / itemsPerPage);
